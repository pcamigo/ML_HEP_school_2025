        "Gaia is a space observatory launched by the European Space Agency (ESA) to chart a three-dimensional map of the Milky Way.\n",
        " - It provides precise astrometric, photometric, and spectroscopic data for over 1.8 billion sources.\n",
        " - Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) includes information such as:\n",
        "   - Positions (RA, DEC)\n",
        "   - Proper motions\n",
        "   - Parallaxes (distance indicators)\n",
        "   - Radial velocities\n",
        "\n",
        "### What are Open Clusters?\n",
        " - Open clusters are groups of stars that formed from the same molecular cloud and are gravitationally bound. They are the young stellar population in the Galactic Disk\n",
        " - They are key to understanding stellar evolution and the structure of the Milky Way.\n",
        " - Identifying membership of stars in open clusters is crucial for determining cluster properties like age, distance, and metallicity.\n",
